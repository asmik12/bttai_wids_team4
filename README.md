To run this project on your own machine with the original, unprocessed dataset, download the publicly available dataset from Kaggle at this link, and add the contents of the `widsdatathon2025` folder to a folder named `data` in the home directory of this repository.

`https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/widsdatathon2025`

Run the `data_preprocessing.ipynb` notebook first to setup and create the merged dataset. Subsequent files in this project will refer to this dataset that will be stored as `merged_data.csv` on your local machine.
